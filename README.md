# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a page designed for a student in the Coding Bootcamp. It was created to contain all of the notes in a centralized space. It's broken up into four main topics which were discussed in the prework.

## Usage

The seperate topics are contained on a single page. I'm hoping to divide these topics into seperate pages for the sake of clarity and ease. Rather than an in-depth discussion of the topics, this page is used to summarize key points made throughout the course. Opening the developer's console will list the four topics discussed and suggest one for study.
